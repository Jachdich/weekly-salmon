:flag_se: :flag_fi: Following decades of neutrality, Sweden and Finland are on track to join NATO. Both countries expressed their intention to join NATO in May, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia strongly opposes the two states joining NATO, as it strengthens the west's defence from Russia. The last hurdle before joining was Turkey, who vetoed their membership due to accusations of assisting Kurdish "terrorist organisations", however a memorandum has been signed by Norway, Sweden and Turkey which "addresses Turkey's concerns". Turkey has now lifted the objection, and Norway and Sweden are now able to start the process of joining NATO, which may take up to a year in normal times, however the critical situation in Ukraine may accelerate this significantly. Some have argued that joining NATO would be bad for Sweden, as it increased tensions and risked an arms race with Russia; and means that Sweden would lose its place as the leader of nuclear disarmament.

:flag_ua: :flag_ru: Russians strengthen attack on the last eastern Ukrainian stronghold Lysychansk, a major city. The USA has announced a further $800 million in weapons for Ukraine, and the UK has added £1 billion in military support for Ukraine. Norway has also announced $1 billion in aid. Ukraine's army has accused Russia of using phosphorus bombs on Snake Island. A missile has hit a shopping centre, with 18 people dead and 36 missing. Russia denies targeting civilians, citing a nearby factory, however further investigation deems this "unlikely" according to the BBC, as the factory was not used for military operations as Russia had claimed.

:flag_in: India bans single use plastics. The production and sale of single-use plastics is forbidden as of the 1st of July. India is among the top contributors to plastic waste, most of which is not disposed of properly, so this law is a huge step towards tackling the problem. Hopefully other countries will follow suit and end the plastic plague once and for all.

:flag_ua: :flag_un: Africa countries are facing a food supply "emergency", at least partially due to the war in Ukraine. Ukraine is a key supplier of grain and has had their exports significantly curbed due to the crisis, which impacts the entire rest of the world. Africa seems to be hit especially hard by this shortage. Edwin Ikhuoria, African Executive Director of the ONE campaign, said they needed "immediate funding" amidst this "emergency".

:flag_us: A new bill, the Health and Location Data Protection Act, has been proposed as a "GDPR lite" for the USA. The bill prohibits the selling and or transferring of location and health data. For example, this should help protect people after the recent Roe V Wade ruling and was even mentioned by a main senator for the bill. Elizabeth Warren said "it is more crucial than ever for Congress to protect consumers' sensitive data”. The proposed bill would also give the FTC and extra $1 Billion in funding, this is likely to help enforce this and similar bills.

:scotland: Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon has proposed the 19th of October 2023 as the date for another independence referendum. Sturgeon said the question would be the same as last time, and has written to PM Boris Johnson for formal consent for the vote to be held. She also stated she would continue with the plan if consent was not granted, but that the referendum would be "indisputably lawful". UK government has stated that "now is not the time" for another referendum. The Supreme Court will decide whether Scottish government has the power to hold the referendum without the permission of UK government. If the court rules that Scotland does not have the power, Sturgeon said the next general election would become a "de facto referendum" with the SNP standing on the single issue of independence. Otherwise, Sturgeon's government would quickly pass its referendum bill. Sturgeon says she is "not willing to ... allow Scottish democrasy to be prisoner of Boris Johnson". According to a poll, 48% of people supported independence, with 47% being opposed, and 5% unsure.

**Science & Research** 
A new study on the effects of space travel on human bones has found that one year after a prolonged spaceflight astronauts had recovered only half of the bone density loss they had accumulated while in space. After a year the average bone density loss in the tibia was 2.1% and the strength loss was 1.3%. This is about typical of 2 decades of being on earth. Exercise regimes in space have been shown to increase the liklihood of regaining more bone density when back on earth.
