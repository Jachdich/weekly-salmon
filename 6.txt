The 51st Pacific Islands Forum was held from 11-14 July in Suva, Fiji. Notably absent was a representative of Palau after they withdrew from the Forum after a dispute regarding the election of the secretary general. The Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands and Nauru have also decided to leave weakening the mandate of the Forum. The US and China are competing for geopolitical power in the Pacific and representatives of these countries were excluded from the meeting. Pacific leaders had space to resolve issues and decide on their key priorities without having to simultaneously navigate meetings with powerful outside players jostling for influence. Kamala Harris, Vice President of the US was permitted to address the Forum virtually, whereas no-one from China was granted the same privilege.

The James Webb Space Telescope has transmitted its first proper images this week. Among these images are one of the SMACS 0723 galaxy cluster, which Hubble also imaged however the JWST required far shorter exposure to produce a better image. Additionally, measurements have been taken of the WASP-96b exoplanet's atmosphere, a feat only posible due to the increased sensitivity of the JWST's infrared detectors.
