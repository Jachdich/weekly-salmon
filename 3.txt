:flag_us: The US supreme court has overturned the constitutional right to abortion. This follows from the Roe vs Wade court case in 1973, which rules that government control of abortion is unconstitutional. This case has recently been overturned meaning that it is now possible for states to decide their own individual abortion laws, and many have already made the practice illegal. Some experts estimate that this decision could reduce the number of legal abortions by only 13 percent, and some speculate that it will drastically increase illegal and unsafe abortions causing more injuries and fatalities. Protests are beginning to form following the decision, which themselves are causing counter-protests from supporters of the decision.

:flag_us: President Biden has signed the "most significant gun control bill in decades". The bill, named the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, mandates increased background checks for younger buyers and allocates money for states with "red flag" laws which allow courts to temporarily confiscate weapons from those considered a threat. Although it is undeniable that it is a significantly improvement on gun control legislation, many question whether it is going far enough. News24 says the bill "falls short of what's really needed", but the white house says it will "save lives". Biden has expressed that he wanted to pass much tougher measures, however these did not make it into the bill due to opposition.

:flag_ru: :flag_by: Russia has announced plans to send nuclear-capable short-range missile systems Belarus. Russia is also helping to modify Belarusian Su-25 war planes to carry nuclear payloads. Some have interpreted this increased mention of nuclear weapons as a warning to the rest of the world, to deter them from intervening in the Russia-Ukraine war.

:flag_mk: :flag_bg: The Bulgarian parliament has voted in favour of a proposal which may go on to unblock North Macedonia from joining the EU, following French negotiations. Bulgaria had previously vetoed North Macedonia in 2020, insisting that the country must formally recognise that its culture and language are derived from Bulgarian, and get rid of alleged anti-Bulgarian sentiment. Many have questioned whether this veto by Bulgaria was "in line with what Europe stands for", so the new decision has been well received as a sign of hope.

:england: Following the by-elections, the Conservative party have lost two key seats, in Wakefield and Tiverton. The Conservative party chair Oliver Dowden resigned immediately after the results were known, stating that the party's supporters are "distressed and disappointed by recent events". Boris Johnson says the results are "not brilliant", but suggests the cost of living crisis was to blame for the loss, rather than himself. Johnson is facing pressure from many sides to resign, but seems confident in his position and dismissed suggestions of resignation as "crazy".

:flag_gb: UK PM Boris Johnson has talked about withdrawing the UK from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). Every nation in Europe except Russia and Belarus are involved in the ECHR. This was brought about after the court stepped in and halted Johnson's plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda. It seems unlikely that this will go ahead, given Johnson's previous comments and opinions on the ECHR, and how controversial the decision would be. Some speculate that conflict with the ECHR can be used as an excuse by the government as to why it is not handling the asylum seekers appropriately.

The earliest ever evidence of a forest fire has been discovered in Wales. It's believed that the tiny fragments of charcoal that indicate the fire are from 430 million years ago, which is before woody plants and trees had evolved. It's likely that giant fungi, up to eight metres tall, were the fuel for the blaze. This also helps us figure out the atmosphere at that time period - for fire, at least 16% O2 is required.
