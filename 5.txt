:flag_us: US President Biden has signed an executive order aimed at protecting access to abortions and contraceptives following the overturning of Roe V Wade. This order "is expected to have a limited impact" due to the fact that Biden's powers can only go so far because US states can make their own laws. Biden has advised that electing more pro-choice senators would help secure abortion rights. The order will also focus on protecting patient privacy.

:flag_jp: Former Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, has been assassinated during a speech in the city of Nara. The former primer minister was delivering a speech during a political campaign when a gunman approached him from behind and with a handmade firearm. The attacker proceeded to shoot Shinzo Abe twice before being wrestled to the ground and detained by security. Shinzo Abe was reportedly treated by doctors for the next four hours, who reported major damage to the former prime minister's heart, and an artery. Japan's longest serving prime minister was pronounced dead at 17:03. The attacker was identified as 41 year old Tetsuya Yamagami, noted to have formerly served in the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force. Yamagami stated he was "dissatisfied" with Shinzo Abe and had shot to kill. The firearm used was reported as handmade, owing to Japan's strict gun laws, however the weapon, although described as "crude"; still proved to be deadly. To say a minimum, the Japanese people are shaken by this event, and Abe has left behind a powerful legacy.

Elon musk has reportedly tried to pull out of the $44 billion twitter purchase deal. Twitter has threatened legal action to force the deal to go through. Musk had previously put the deal on hold due to twitter failing to provide information on spam/fake accounts, and firing two top managers in breach of their contract. Musk would be required to pay a $1 billion fee if he does not complete the deal. Bret Taylo, chair of Twitter, said "The Twitter Board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr Musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement".

:flag_pk: :flag_af: There has been intense flooding in Southern Pakistan and South and East Afghanistan. Eight dams burst, and hundreds of houses have been destroyed. More than eighty people lost their lives as almost double the normal monsoon rains have fallen this year. The Pakistani Navy is providing relief for their citizens but emergency services are not as well equipped across the border in Afghanistan.

:flag_ir: Iran has escilated its uranium enrichment, reportedly up to 20% fissile, which is less than the 60% enrichement being produced elsewhere in Iran. Power reactors usually use 5-6% enriched, and 90% is weapons grade. The International Atomic Agency verified that Iran began feeding uranium hexaflouride (5% fissile) into 166 IR-6 centrifuges which have modified sub-headers, allowing them to switch to higher purity levels easily and quickly. Iran says this is for peaceful purposes, but this new programme has decreased the already slim chances of reviving the nuclear deal.

Sony has once again reminded us that you donâ€™t own anything digital. From august in Germany and Austria, films bought from studio canal on the PlayStation store will no longer be available to access. They can do this since in the terms of service it states that you only lease digital content for as long as Sony keeps it on the platform. This should act as a wakeup call to anyone who thought that you own digital content.

:flag_gb: In shock news, the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has finally resigned as leader of the Conservative party, after many members of his cabinet resigned and called for his resignation. Among them was Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Chancellor Rishi Sunak, two of Boris' highest ranking members of government. Despite this, Boris will continue on as Prime Minister until either he is ousted by parliament or the Tory Party presents a replacement, likely by October. There has already been calls for his resignation as Prime Minister now, due to Boris being essentially a 'Lame Duck' prime minister, being controlled by the cabinet. It is widely considered that this will lead to yet another early General Election, likely in 2023.

**Science and Research**
A new species of large predatory dinosaur has been discovered in the Patagonia region of Argentina. Called *Meraxes gigas* this huge carcharodontosaurid had tiny but extremely strong arms and an enormous head. Scientists have proposed that the large head in species such as this and *Tyrannosaurus rex* fulfilled some of the functions of arms but nevertheless the strength of the arms suggests they have important roles to play too. One idea is that the arms allow the giant animal to right itself if it overbalanced, or that they are necessary during reproductive behaviour. *M. gigas* was found in Late Cretaceous rocks, around 90 million years old. Its arms are only half the length of its skull.
