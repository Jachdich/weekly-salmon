:flag_gb: Economic woes: The United Kingdom’s economy is set to enter into a recession until at least the end of 2023, says the Bank of England. This would be the biggest slump in economic growth since the 2008 recession. While it may not be as deep a cut into the UK’s economy, the recession may last just as long. The bank has also predicted that Inflation will peak at 13.3%. This inflation, driven by energy bills which will grow even more in October, is trying to be kerbed by the Bank of England raising interest rates sharply to 1.75%. This is likely one of the catalysts of this recession, as it makes people take out less debt and save more, which simultaneously decreases inflation and economic growth. Many economic analysts have warned that we may be entering into a period of stag-flation, characterised by low economic growth, high inflation and high unemployment, but the last prerequisite is yet to be fulfilled.

According to the RMT leader, Mick Lynch, this was the only day that they could have striked on that would not have been during the commonwealth games. More strikes by RMT and others will take place on 18th and 20th of august. A number of strikes and other industrial action are planned in other professions, such as BT, royal mail, barristers, and police officers.
