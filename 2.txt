Growing numbers of young Africans want to move abroad, survey suggests. African youth have lost confidence in their own countries and the continent as a whole to meet their aspirations and a rising number are considering moving abroad, according to a survey of young people from 15 countries. Frustration seemed to have increased the desire to emigrate. While the previous survey found more than two-thirds of young people wanting to stay put, now 52% planned to move abroad in the next three years, with the number increasing to three-quarters in Nigeria and Sudan.
