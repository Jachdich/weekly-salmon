:flag_uk: Liz Truss has been appointed as prime minister by the now dead Queen. She made it through the rounds of voting by Conservative MPs and was picked as the new PM by around 200-300,000 Tory Members. She won 57.4% of the vote, compared to Dishi Rishi's 42.6% of the vote (duh..), making it the least convincing Tory Leadership election win since the rules were last changed. Liz Truss is widely considered to be to the right of Joris Bohnson, supporting more aggressive tax cuts and holding a deep connection to oil and gas companies. She is also an staunch supporter of the Rwada Policy, where some migrants are sent by plane to the African nation. Many individuals and parties such as Ed Davey have already called for another general election.
